FAQ:
<br>
Don't p2pool payments take longer to confirm?</p>
<p>No. In a traditional pool, after a block is generated, the pool waits for 120 confirmations before
paying out the block. When 120 confirmations are received, the balance moves from "unconfirmed" to
"confirmed" and you are paid out, either automatically if set, or manually if you choose that option.
You then wait for that payment transaction from the pool to your wallet to confirm before the coins
are spendable. With p2pool, you receive the coins immediately the block is generated, however you
must wait for 120 network confirmations to be able to spend them. So p2pool generated coins are
spendable slightly sooner than those generated by a traditional pool.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Doesn't p2pool generate more stale shares?</p>
<p>P2Pool creates a "sharechain" similar to the main Dogecoin blockchain. On this chain, blocks take 10
seconds to generate. The main Dogecoin blockchain targets a 2.5 minute block time, so approximately
every 2.5 minutes there is a window of opportunity for your worker to find a valid share in the previous
block, but submit it once another worker already found a block - this is a stale share.</p>

<p>The shorter blocktime of the p2pool sharechain means this window of opportunity for a stale share to
happen occurs more often, so you will have more stale shares, however this doesn't reduce your income
provided that your stale percentage (Look for your Dogecoin address in the "Local Workers" section of
the main page) is not higher than the average for all p2pool workers (See the "P2Pool Total" item, in
the "Hash Rate" section of the main page). In fact, if your stale ratio is lower than the average, you
profit from the stales generated by other workers, by having a higher overall percentage of the valid
shares.</p> 

<p>So, for example, even if your stales were 5%, and p2pool as a whole was generating a 6% ratio of stales,
you would be making more on p2pool than you would on a traditional pool, since the stale ratio on the
sharechain does not correspond to stale (orphaned) blocks on the main blockchain.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">My worker is getting a lot of hardware errors</p>

<p>Because of the short blocktimes on the p2pool sharechain, your workers need to receive much lower 
difficulty work than they would in a traditional pool. They must finish their work and submit it
before it goes stale - on the main blockchain, this would happen every time a block was generated
(every 2.5 minutes on average), wheras on p2pool a new block on the sharechain happens every 10
seconds on average. Very low difficulty work often causes hardware errors. You can prevent this by
telling p2pool the minimum difficulty your worker requires. You do this by appending a string to
the end of your username (your Dogecoin address) in your miners startup command. The formula for
calculating what to append is:</p>

<code>Dogecoin Address + 0.00000116 * Hash Rate in KH/s</code>
<br>
So, if your hashrate was 350KH/s, you would calculate: 
<br>
<code>0.00000116 * 350 = 0.000406</code>
<br>
If your Dogecoin address is D7bBdhp4uwejabSM2Eui1j9w5SbGYbwwVd: 
<br>
<code>D7bBdhp4uwejabSM2Eui1j9w5SbGYbwwVd+0.000406</code>
<br>
as your p2pool username.
<br>

<br><p>You don't want to set this value too high, or you will increase your stale shares - it sets the
minimum difficulty for the shares you receive, and if you set it too high you will receive a large
percentage of shares that are too difficulty for your worker to complete before the next block is
generated, so the work will go stale. Setting this parameter is a balancing act between submitting
work fast enough to avoid stales, and obtaining work that is difficult enough that it doesn't
produce HW errors, or consume unnecessary bandwidth (if you have a very low minimum difficulty,
your worker has to ask the pool for work too often, consuming extra bandwidth unnecessarily).</p>

Here are some suggested values for various hashrates:
<br>
<blockquote style="border-radius: 10px; padding: 3px; width: 190px">
<pre style="border:0px; background-color: #ccc">
<strong>KHash/s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficulty</strong>
50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+0.00005821
100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+0.00011641
250&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+0.00029103
500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+0.00058207
750&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+0.00087310
1000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+0.00116414
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight:bold">Is p2pool Vardiff?</p>

<p>Yes, p2pool uses vardiff, but it is highly recommended to calculate your target difficulty as
explained above for your workers hashrate. This will result in the optimum minimum size of work
for your hashrate, reducing stale shares and consuming as little bandwidth as possible. It will
also prevent hardware errors which can occur with worksizes that are too small.</p>
